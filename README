This uses the Translation code from a defunct plugin at
https://sites.google.com/site/kashmirplugins/home/translator.

The YouTube trailer and search functionality has been removed (as it did
not work, and other YT plugins exist).

The code has been rationalized, and it should be (or will become)
Python3 compatible.

The entries here are:
