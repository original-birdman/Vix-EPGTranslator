This uses the Translation code from a defunct plugin at
https://sites.google.com/site/kashmirplugins/home/translator.

The YouTube trailer and search functionality has been removed (as it did
not work, and other YT plugins exist).

The code has been rationalized, and it should be (or will become)
Python3 compatible.

The entries here are:

MakeHTML5Entities.pl
    A script to create the HTML5Entities.py source from the full list of
    HTML5 entities at w3.org.

ipkg-build
    An editied version of the ipkg-build script from the Vix opkg-tools
    with a few modifications to make it a simple build script for this
    package.
    Just run it in this directory.
