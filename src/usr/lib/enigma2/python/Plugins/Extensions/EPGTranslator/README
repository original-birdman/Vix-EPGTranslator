When activated this plugin will provide a translation of programme
descriptions, using translate.google.com.
Translations for a programme are cached (in memory - there is no
persistent database)

If you start the plugin through the plugin menu it will display the
translation for the current programme. You can move through this using
the < and > keys, and move to other services using ch+ and ch-.

Pressing the Menu key takes you to the configuration options where you
may set:

    o The Source language (the default is "auto")
    o The Destination language (the default is English)
    o The timeout (in hours) for cached entries (the default is to leave
      them in place until they would drop out of the EPG)
    o Whether to show the original description along with the
      translation

When the plugin's programme description screen is active you may also
press

    o Red - to completely clear the cache
    o Blue - to hide the description screen (but leave it running).
      Pressing Blue again unhides it.

You may also get translation in some EventView screens.  This works for
those arrived at by pressing the Info key (or equivalent) when watching
a programme or in the Grid EPG.
Here the Text key will toggle between original and translated text. Each
new view starts in non-translating mode.
