Added files to the git repository.

========== 2.0 STARTS [21 Dec 2020]

Added build ipk package for 2.0

========== 2.0+ipk STARTS [21 Dec 2020]

README + Dev branch
    Added Dev branch and updated README to mention it

plugin.py
    Added ".decode('utf-8')" to urlopen() call. Needed for Py3, and
    missed on copying in from test code.
    Added plugin-source symlink for easier access to source files.

plugin.py
    Change the test for "no text" in translateText() and translateEPG()
    and correct the (previously wrong) indentation in the latter.

plugin.py
    Switch to using epgcache.lookupEvent() to get events (based on EPG
    TranslatorLite.
    Get the EPG starting from the normal histminutes previous, rather
    than just getting all EPG entries (which can go back well beyond
    that). Then start with the current event.

plugin.py
    Switch off wrapping at the beginning and end of the displayed list.

plugin.py
    Change the returns list for epgcache.lookupEvent() to be only those
    used, and parametrize the handling to robustify any additions or
    changes.

plugin.py
    Cache the EPG translations, so that we don't need to redo the web
    call on a return to a previously-seen item.

plugin.py
    Move the text translation call into a stand-alone DO_translation()
    function so that it may be called from anywhere.

plugin.py
    Add code to intercept EventView pop-ups and add translations there
    toggled by the Text key.

========== 2.01-rc1 STARTS [11 Jan 2021]


AutoflushCache.py
    Added code to handle cacheing the translations. In its own class.

Skin_medium.py, Skin_small.py
    (Re)added the label2 item for the Read, clear-cache button

plugin.py
    Change the User-Agent string to be "EPG Translator" based.
    Remember all events, not just a (configurable) number.
    Re-ordered some code.
    Added cacheing of translated text.
    Add configurable cacheing timeout.
    Add red-button handling to clear cache.
    Add handling of translations for EventView items using the Text
    button as a toggle.
    Removed My_EPGSel* functions.

*-2.01-rc1.ipk
    Built....

========== 2.01-rc2 STARTS [13 Jan 2021]

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
    Enlarged the translatorConfig screen.
    Added the (forgotten) yellow image back to translatorMain.

plugin.py
    Add lang_flag() function, just to have only one place that knows how
    to form the pathnames.
    Don't add ch+/ (or rather "nextBouquet" and "prevBouquet") button
    bindings if we are viewing a recording, not </>.
    Use a ServiceEventTracker to call getEPG on service (channel)
    changes rather than doing this in zapUp/zapDown..  This means we
    don't try until the new channel is actually tuned it, and so works
    even when a timeshift is running (the user may be prompted before
    anything happens).
    Handle viewing a playback of a recording by creating a hand-crafted
    EPG with one entry.

README
    Update the release README to add more detail.

*-2.01-rc2.ipk
    Built 2.01-rc2.ipk.  2.01-rc1.ipk removed.

========== 2.01-rc3 STARTS

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
    Fixed some minor separator geometry issues.

plugin.py
    Removed [..] trailing props before sending them for translation, and
    add them back afterwards for display.
    Prevents en -> de changing [S,AD] to [TRAURIG]

AutoflushCache.py
    Define, in __init__(), the value to return for "not found" key
    lookups. This allows the storage of (title, descr) tuples (and
    other things).

plugin.py
    Put list() around range()s, for Py3.
    Reformat language list (to use fewer lines).
    Update AutoflushCache() calls to store a (title, descr) tuple.
    Move 2000 char test into the DO_translation() function.
    Translate both the Title and Description for programmes (still done
    in a single call to translate.google.com)
    Replaced the isPlayback() test for being in playback mode, as it's
    Vix specific.
    Add a my_Sref() method, as we need a serviceref in a few locations.
    Add the current service (channel) name to the title in the
    translator EPG browser.
    strip() all text we are asked to translate.
    Append a newline to the begin text, and prepend one to the duration
    text instead.  Gives consistency.
    Cater for recordings with no Event info (happens for downloaded
    files).
    Add try/except clauses when fetching data to translate so that if
    something goes wrong we just fail to translate, rather than crash.
    Change the "EventID" for a recording to be the dev:inode for the
    recording, rather than its full pathname.
    In My_setEvent() get the title text from self["epg_eventname"], then
    update both that and setTitle() with the translation, as skins may
    be using either.

enigma2-plugin-extensions-translator_2.0-rc2_all.ipk
    Deleted
    Dev releases will no longer be put on github.
    They will be posted here (and later posts)

Added the 2.01-rc3 tag.

========== 2.01-rc4 STARTS

plugin.py
    Added a regex handler for [] groups being at the start of a
    descripton. Use it if char1 is [, use the end group match if chsar-1
    is ] and do not matching otherwise.
    Removed the 3-char limit for an individual tag within [].
    Updated version tag to 2.01-rc4

========== 2.01-rc5 STARTS

plugin.py
    Add Mozilla/5.0 compat to User Agent string
    Version now shown in configuration menu.
    Raised encoded text length limit from 2000 to 7000 after testing
    what was allowed.
    Add "debug" print statements to some except clauses, so oddities
    can be recorded.
    Fixed My_setEvent() to use the new begin_matcher+end_matcher
    regexes.
    Updated version tag to 2.01-rc5

control
    Built ipk
    Added the 2.01-rc5 tag to git

========== 2.01-rc6 STARTS

plugin.py
    Rename my_Sref() to my_Sref() for a consistent use of My.
    Change debug print tags from EPGTranslator to EPGTranslator-Plugin,
    to make clear this is happening in a plugin.
    If we don't have an Event or 'getEventName' in the Event then don't
    try to do anything. Otherwise we'll get a crash.
    Change My_setEvent() to set all known possible text fields in the
    event, but only if the tag exists.

    Add global split_off_props() function for the common functionality,
    and in it check that descr contains text before checking descr[0].

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
plugin.py
    Move time and duration or programme into own window, so it is only
    displayed once.

    Do not show property groups in right-to-left translations.

========== 2.01-rc9 STARTS

plugin.py
    Remove self.source and self.destination and replace them throughout
    by CfgPlTr.source.value and CfgPlTr.destination.value, as the self.*
    values are not updated after a language change in the config menu.

plugin.py
    Fix split_off_props() and its regexes to trap minimal property
    groups (with the correct end bracket matching the opening one).
    Check for [ within the first 12 characters to allow for an opening
    () group.

========== 2.02-rc1 STARTS [10 Feb 2021]

plugin.py
    Implemented a loop over Google translate calls using the
    PART_translate() function to overcome any ~7500 character limit.
    DO_translation() now unzips for call to this then stitches things
    back up, as required.
    No longer distinguish URLError, HTTPError and socket errors. An
    error is now just a failure to translate.
    Updated version tag to 2.02-rc1

plugin.py
    Add code to ignore props with rtol text to My_setEvent() lookups as
    well.

plugin.py
    Don't unquote() the translated text - it isn't quote()d.
    If an EPG translation doesn't start with sepline there has been a
    problem, so handle it accordingly.

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
plugin.py
    Make icon locations relative to the script, rather than hardwiring
    full pathnames.

plugin.py
    For a playback, set the begin time to when the programme started
    during playback (rather than None).

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
plugin.py
    Add an option to display a traceback of an error during translation,
    rather than just the description.
    Fixed up skins for this (and fixed Skin_small layout).

plugin.py
    Change config.x.x.value usage to config.x.x.getValue(). OpenPLi
    make config.epg.histminutes.value a str, not an int.
