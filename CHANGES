README + Dev branch
    Added Dev branch and updated README to mention it

plugin.py
    Added ".decode('utf-8')" to urlopen() call. Needed for Py3, and
    missed on copying in from test code.
    Added plugin-source symlink for easier access to source files.

plugin.py
    Change the test for "no text" in translateText() and translateEPG()
    and correct the (previously wrong) indentation in the latter.

plugin.py
    Switch to using epgcache.lookupEvent() to get events (based on EPG
    TranslatorLite.
    Get the EPG starting from the normal histminutes previous, rather
    than just getting all EPG entries (which can go back well beyond
    that). Then start with the current event.

plugin.py
    Switch off wrapping at the beginning and end of the displayed list.

plugin.py
    Change the returns list for epgcache.lookupEvent() to be only those
    used, and parametrize the handling to robustify any additions or
    changes.

plugin.py
    Cache the EPG translations, so that we don't need to redo the web
    call on a return to a previously-seen item.

plugin.py
    Move the text translaton call into a stand-alone DO_translation()
    function so that it may be called from anywhere.

    Add code to intercept EventView pop-ups and add translations there
    toggled by the Text key.

    Add configurable cacheing timeout.
    Add red-button handling to clear cache.
    Add handling of translations for EventView items using the Text
    button as a toggle.
