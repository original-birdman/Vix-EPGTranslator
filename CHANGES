Added files to the git repository.

========== 2.0 [21 Dec 2020]

Added build ipk package for 2.0

========== 2.0+ipk [21 Dec 2020]

README + Dev branch
    Added Dev branch and updated README to mention it

plugin.py
    Added ".decode('utf-8')" to urlopen() call. Needed for Py3, and
    missed on copying in from test code.
    Added plugin-source symlink for easier access to source files.

plugin.py
    Change the test for "no text" in translateText() and translateEPG()
    and correct the (previously wrong) indentation in the latter.

plugin.py
    Switch to using epgcache.lookupEvent() to get events (based on EPG
    TranslatorLite.
    Get the EPG starting from the normal histminutes previous, rather
    than just getting all EPG entries (which can go back well beyond
    that). Then start with the current event.

plugin.py
    Switch off wrapping at the beginning and end of the displayed list.

plugin.py
    Change the returns list for epgcache.lookupEvent() to be only those
    used, and parametrize the handling to robustify any additions or
    changes.

plugin.py
    Cache the EPG translations, so that we don't need to redo the web
    call on a return to a previously-seen item.

plugin.py
    Move the text translation call into a stand-alone DO_translation()
    function so that it may be called from anywhere.

plugin.py
    Add code to intercept EventView pop-ups and add translations there
    toggled by the Text key.

========== 2.01-rc1 [11 Jan 2021]


AutoflushCache.py
    Added code to handle cacheing the translations. In its own class.

Skin_medium.py, Skin_small.py
    (Re)added the label2 item for the Read, clear-cache button

plugin.py
    Change the User-Agent string to be "EPG Translator" based.
    Remember all events, not just a (configurable) number.
    Re-ordered some code.
    Added cacheing of translated text.
    Add configurable cacheing timeout.
    Add red-button handling to clear cache.
    Add handling of translations for EventView items using the Text
    button as a toggle.
    Removed My_EPGSel* functions.

*-2.01-rc1.ipk
    Built....

========== 2.01-rc2 [13 Jan 2021]

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
    Enlarged the translatorConfig screen.
    Added the (forgotten) yellow image back to translatorMain.

plugin.py
    Add lang_flag() function, just to have only one place that knows how
    to form the pathnames.
    Don't add ch+/ (or rather "nextBouquet" and "prevBouquet") button
    bindings if we are viewing a recording, not </>.
    Use a ServiceEventTracker to call getEPG on service (channel)
    changes rather than doing this in zapUp/zapDown..  This means we
    don't try until the new channel is actually tuned it, and so works
    even when a timeshift is running (the user may be prompted before
    anything happens).
    Handle viewing a playback of a recording by creating a hand-crafted
    EPG with one entry.

README
    Update the release README to add more detail.

*-2.01-rc2.ipk
    Built 2.01-rc2.ipk.  2.01-rc1.ipk removed.

========== 2.01-rc3

Skin_medium.py
Skin_small.py
    Fixed some minor separator geometry issues.

plugin.py
    Removed [..] trailing props before sending them for translation, and
    add them back afterwards for display.
    Prevents en -> de changing [S,AD] to [TRAURIG]

AutoflushCache.py
    Define, in __init__(), the value to return for "not found" key
    lookups. This allows the storage of (title, descr) tuples (and
    other things).

plugin.py
    Put list() around range()s, for Py3.
    Reformat language list (to use fewer lines).
    Update AutoflushCache() calls to store a (title, descr) tuple.
    Move 2000 char test into the DO_translation() function.
    Translate both the Title and Description for programmes (still done
    in a single call to translate.google.com)
    Replaced the isPlayback() test for being in playback mode, as it's
    Vix specific.
    Add a my_Sref() method, as we need a serviceref in a few locations.
    Add the current service (channel) name to the title in the
    translator EPG browser.
    strip() all text we are asked to translate.
    Append a newline to the begin text, and prepend one to the duration
    text instead.  Gives consistency.
    Cater for recordings with no Event info (happens for downloaded
    files).
    Add try/except clauses when fetching data to translate so that if
    something goes wrong we just fail to translate, rather than crash.
    Change the "EventID" for a recording to be the dev:inode for the
    recording, rather than its full pathname.
    In My_setEvent() get the title text from self["epg_eventname"], then
    update both that and setTitle() with the translation, as skins may
    be using either.

Added the 2.01-rc3 tag.
    Dev releases will no longer be put on github.
    They will be posted here (and later posts)
